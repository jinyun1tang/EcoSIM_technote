    "## General description\n",
    "EcoSIM is land biogeochemical model designed to simulate plant-soil-microbial interactions in natural and managed ecosystems under varying climate forcing. It adopts the mechanistically-based approach by employing physical rules to the maximum extent in describing transport, uptake, and chemical transformations of mass and energy. It uses the average representative approach to represent the plant and microbial populations. For plants, EcoSIM considers the interactions between biogeocheistry and biogeophysics in the context of explicitly tracking of each plant's morphological and phenolgoical development. This allows the characterization of plants in terms of measurable trait parameters that control light caputuring, photosynthesis and respiration, canopy and root phenolgoical and morphological development, drought and heat tolerance, nutrient acquisition, and geometrically-thermodynamically-constrained organ-specific biometric allocation and elemental stoichoimetry (C:N:P). For soil microbes, it represents 11 functional groups that conduct biogeochemistry involing organic matter, acetate, methane, reduced and oxidized nitrogen species, and oxygen in five oraganic matter complexes such as fine litter, coarse woody litter, manure, POM and humus. In the soil, plant roots and microbes compete for oxygen and mineral nutrients in the presence of modulations by aqueous geochemistry and multiphase transport (gaseous, aqueous, and precipitation-dissolution). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because EcoSIM focuses on mechanisms, it enables the many response parameters to emerge, a methodology that is differ significant from many other models. For instance, in biological growth, EcoSIM abandons the idea of fixed carbon use efficiency and nutrient use efficiency, rather it allows such response parameters to emerge from the interactions of more basic processes, e.g. storage, cost of assimilative uptake and maintenance. Other similar emergent parameters include temperature sensitivity of hetetrotrohpic respiration, plant respiration, and the response of photosynthesis to vapor pressure deficit.       "

    "# EcoSIM uniqness\n",
    "\n",
    "As a land biogeochemical model that explicitly couples microbial community dynamics with plant and soil biogeochemistry, EcoSIM distinguishes itself from other existing land biogeochemical models through the following major aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Explicit representation of microbial processes**: EcoSIM explicitly represents microbes that carry out carbon decomposition, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, and methane cycling. It also couples microbial biochemistry with aqueous geochemistry and surface chemistry. For each soil layer in the model, it has 13 microbial functional groups in five groups of organic matter complexes. It also includes nitrogen fixation in both the canopy and soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed representation of plant morphology and phenology**: EcoSIM considers detailed plant morphology and geometry for seeds, fruits, primary and secondary roots, branches, and leaves. It also represents the entire lifecycle of plants, from seed planting to seed harvest. For typical crops, such as corn or maize, the represented phenology can be compared directly to the system used for field monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **First-principles based formulation**: EcoSIM makes the maximum use of first-principles to formulate its model processes. This means that many relationships that are used as parameterizations in other models, such as photosynthetic Vmax and respiration Q10 in ELM, can emerge as special cases of model responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mechanistic representation of ecosystem management**: EcoSIM's mechanistic representation allows for comprehensive treatment of ecosystem management practices, including fire, insect attack, grazing, crop rotation, diverse fertilizer application, N2O inhibition, tillage, irrigation, and ecosystem warming.\n",
    "Explicit trait coupling between plants and microbes: EcoSIM explicitly couples plants and microbes through diverse biogeochemical and biogeophysical traits, which enables the simulation of ecosystem performance in the presence of concurrent competition for light, water, and nutrients.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Coupling of soil organic matter dynamics with soil physical properties**: EcoSIM explicitly couples soil organic matter dynamics with soil physical properties, such as heat capacity, soil porosity, and water conductivity. This enables a more complete coupling between ecosystem biogeochemistry and biogeophysics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalability**: EcoSIM can simulate soil incubation, greenhouse experiments, and gridded regions using the same model parameterization.\n",

    "## Forcing data\n",
    "\n",
    "EcoSIM assumes daily forcing data if used should appear before hourly data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soil volume**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each soil layer, 1 m$^3$ is seprated into rock volume, soil mass volume, macropore volume and micropore volume. After subtracting the rock volume, the total volume is separated into macropore, micropore and solid materials holding these pores. Total porosity is sum of macropores and micropores. The micropore soil volume refers to the volume of the soil fractions occupied by micropores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil bulk density refers to the density of soil that excludes rock.\n",
    "\n",
    "EcoSIM output relative soil saturation by dividing the water-filled pore volume (normalized by the total soil volume, excluding rock) with the soil pore volume, where the latter is computed with bulk density and particle density (as a function of soil organic matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil porosity is defined as volume of pore space in a unit volume of soil. The unit is m3/m3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soil bulk density**\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil bulk density is defined as the dry weight of soil per unit volume of soil. It is typically expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). This measurement includes both the volume of soil particles and the volume of pores among soil particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bulk density considers the combined volume of solids and pore space, whereas particle density only considers the mineral solids1. It is an indicator of soil compaction and can be calculated by dividing the oven-dry weight of soil by its volume at field moisture capacity or another specified moisture content.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in an ideal soil where half is solids and half is pore space, the bulk density would be around 1.33 g/cm³. However, bulk density can vary depending on soil texture, organic matter content, and management practices, typically ranging from 1.0 to 1.8 g/cm³ for mineral soils.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macropores (pores larger than 75 µm) are part of the total pore space in soil and are therefore included in the volume used to calculate bulk density.\n",
    "\n",
    "High macroporosity generally corresponds to lower bulk density because macropores increase the total volume without adding mass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship between rocks and bulk density in measurements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inclusion of rocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, when measuring soil bulk density, rocks and coarse fragments (particles >2 mm in size) are included in the measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Challenges with rocky soils:\n",
    "\n",
    "Soils with substantial amounts of coarse fragments present special challenges for bulk density measurements.\n",
    "Inserting the core or probe may be difficult or impossible due to coarse fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Effect on bulk density:\n",
    "Coarse fragments are denser than soil, so their presence inside a sample will increase the apparent bulk density of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Measurement methods:\n",
    "The core method, which is commonly used for bulk density measurements, includes rocks in the sample volume.\n",
    "Some other methods, like excavation methods, may allow for separation and measurement of rock volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Considerations:\n",
    "In some cases, researchers may choose to report bulk density on a \"rock-free\" basis, but this is not the standard approach.\n",
    "When rocks are present, it's important to note their presence and potentially their volume fraction in the soil.\n",
    "Importance of consistency:\n",
    "Whatever method is chosen (including or excluding rocks), it should be applied consistently and reported clearly to ensure comparability of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Importance of consistency:\n",
    "Whatever method is chosen (including or excluding rocks), it should be applied consistently and reported clearly to ensure comparability of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Interpretation:\n",
    "When interpreting bulk density results for soils with significant rock content, it's important to consider how the rocks might be affecting the measurement.\n"

    "Summary from perplexity AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key phenological stages of annual grasses typically include:\n",
    "1. Germination: Seeds germinate and emerge from the soil, usually in fall or early spring depending on the species and environmental conditions.\n",
    "2. Vegetative growth: The grass produces leaves and tillers, expanding its biomass. This stage is characterized by rapid growth and leaf production.\n",
    "3. Stem elongation: The stems begin to elongate and become jointed, with nodes and internodes becoming visible.\n",
    "4. Boot stage: The developing seed head is enclosed within the sheath of the flag leaf but not yet visible.\n",
    "5. Heading: The seed head emerges from the leaf sheath. This marks the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth.\n",
    "6. Flowering: Anthers emerge and pollen is released. This stage is crucial for seed production.\n",
    "7. Seed development: Seeds form and mature within the seed heads.\n",
    "8. Senescence: The plant begins to dry out and turn brown as seeds reach maturity.\n",
    "9. Seed dispersal: Mature seeds are dispersed, often by wind or animal movement.\n",
    "10. Death: The annual plant completes its lifecycle and dies, leaving behind seeds for the next generation.\n",

    "The research indicates these triggers can vary across ecoregions, with precipitation being more influential in arid regions and temperature playing a larger role in wetter regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is often an interaction between temperature and moisture availability in triggering phenological transitions.\n",
    "Events preceding the actual onset of growth, like winter precipitation, can influence the timing of spring germination and growth.\n",

The axial resistance is a function of xylem radius, and number of xylem per root, two varaibles that are related to the root radius. Physically, greater xylem radius and more xylem tubes there are, lower is the axial resistance. The radial resistance is related to the effective root surface area (covered by aqua porins) for water uptake. Azaizeh and Steudle (1991) indicate that under salty conditions, the magnitude can be of $10^7 \\mathrm{~MPa~s~m}^{-4}$.
